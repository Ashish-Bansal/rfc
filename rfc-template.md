# Summary

[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the proposed contribution.

# Motivation

[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Reference-level explanation

[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the contribution would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.
- Dependencies on libraries, tools, projects or work that isn't yet complete.

# Drawbacks

[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we _not_ do this?

# Prior art

[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- Does this functionality exist in other software and what experience has their community had?
- For other teams: What lessons can we learn from what other communities have done here?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other languages, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture.
If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other languages.

# Unresolved questions

[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this functionality before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?

# Future possibilities

[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the
RFC you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities,
you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.
