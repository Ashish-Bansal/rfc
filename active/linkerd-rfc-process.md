# Summary

[summary]: #summary

The Linkerd project needs a formal process to shepherd contributions from the community into the project. This involves a proposal that defines and explains the motivations and technical implications of the work to be done.

# Motivation

[motivation]: #motivation

This work will make it clear to external contributors how to get their contributions into Linkerd and the status of that work at any point in the process. It also enables the Linkerd maintainers to understand the progression of work coming into the project, it's status and whether it's waiting on their involvement.

# Reference-level explanation

[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

We will be using the 'RFC' repository on in the Linkerd Github organization to store active and archived RFC's and the review / acceptence process through pull requests.

# Drawbacks

[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Github is a more difficult medium for conversation than Google Doc, but it does centralize the process.

# Prior art

[prior-art]: #prior-art

Previously this work was all managed via Github issues in projects boards, with Google docs used to do planning and discussion.

# Unresolved questions

- As much of this was adapted from the Rust RFC process, I removed RFC #'s, because I wasn't clear on the utility, but that could be re-introduced if needed.

# Future possibilities

This is a starting place and can/should be ammended if there are obvious improvements.
